Welcome to my website! My name is Dr. Helen Seitzer, and I am currently working as a postdoctoral researcher in the project "Inclusiveness and Generosity of Education Systems" at the University of Bremen, Germany. We examine the historical development of the inclusiveness of education systems globally.

My research interests lie in the field of education policy and policy development. I am fascinated by the intricate dynamics of education systems and how they shape individuals' lives and influence and are influenced by societies as a whole. Specifically, I focus on studying the involvement and activity of international organizations such as the OECD, World Bank, and UNESCO in education policymaking. Understanding the role and impact of these organizations is crucial for developing effective and equitable education policies on a global scale.

In addition to my expertise in education policy, I have a keen interest in cutting-edge methodologies that enhance our understanding of complex social phenomena. I am particularly enthusiastic about computational social science methodologies, social network analysis, advances in quantitative text analysis, and machine learning techniques. These methodologies enable us to uncover valuable insights from vast amounts of data, providing a deeper understanding of the factors influencing educational outcomes and the effectiveness of policy interventions.

I am passionate about teaching and giving the next generations the confidence to engage with difficult topics such as statistics. I love to encourage my students to work and think independently create a better understanding not only of the topics I am teaching on, but also about the research process itself.

If you have any questions, suggestions, or opportunities for collaboration, please feel free to reach out. I am always excited to connect with fellow researchers, policymakers, and individuals passionate about education policy.
